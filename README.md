**GeFi Token** is the native utility and governance token powering the GeFi (Generative Finance) ecosystem — a privacy-preserving, federated AI platform for collaborative financial model development.

> **Note:** GeFi Token is an internal blockchain-based incentive mechanism designed for rewarding contributions in a regulated, institutional-grade federated learning network. It is **not** a publicly traded cryptocurrency, investment vehicle, or speculative asset.

## Overview

GeFi revolutionizes financial AI by enabling secure, collaborative model training across developers, financial institutions, and data providers — without ever sharing raw data.

The platform combines:
- **Federated Learning** for privacy-preserving AI development
- **Blockchain Ledger** for transparent contribution tracking
- **Smart Contracts** for automated rewards and governance
- **AI Model Marketplace** for licensing refined models

GeFi Token serves as the economic backbone, incentivizing high-quality participation and aligning stakeholders in a self-sustaining AI economy.

## Token Utility

GeFi Token has the following core functions:

- **Contribution Rewards**: Developers and data providers receive automated token rewards based on the quality and impact of their encrypted model updates.
- **Model Ownership Tokens**: Participants earn non-transferable (or limited) tokens as proof of participation in specific model iterations — verifiable attestations of contribution.
- **Governance**: Token holders participate in protocol upgrades, parameter adjustments, and ecosystem decisions via on-chain voting.
- **Incentive Alignment**: Rewards ensure fair compensation, encouraging ongoing collaboration and model improvement.

Tokens are earned through verifiable contributions — **not purchased or sold publicly**.

## Key Features of the Ecosystem

- **Privacy-Preserving**: Raw data never leaves local environments (Homomorphic Encryption, Secure MPC, Differential Privacy).
- **Regulatory Compliant**: Built-in Compliance Engine with Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and regulator notifications.
- **Transparent & Auditable**: All contributions, updates, and rewards recorded immutably on-chain.
- **Incentivized Participation**: Smart contracts distribute rewards proportionally to contribution quality.
- **Decentralized Intelligence**: Global financial models evolve collaboratively.
